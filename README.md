Zf2Doctrine2-Skeleton
=====================

This is a working Skeleton Application of ZF2 with Doctrine 2.

It includes an example of generating Entities from XMl/YAML files.

I inspired myself from this realy nice post: http://www.fadoe.de/blog/archives/388-ZF2-und-Doctrine-als-Modul-einbinden.html
