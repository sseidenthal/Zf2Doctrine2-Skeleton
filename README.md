# Zf2Doctrine2-Skeleton

This is a working Skeleton Application of ZF2 with Doctrine 2.

It includes an example of generating entities from XMl/YAML files.

I inspired myself from this realy nice post: http://www.fadoe.de/blog/archives/388-ZF2-und-Doctrine-als-Modul-einbinden.html

## How to setup the easiest way
Note: on a Mac with ZendServer 6 installed
```
git clone https://github.com/sseidenthal/Zf2Doctrine2-Skeleton.git
cd Zf2Doctrine2-Skeleton
php composer.phar self-update
php composer.phar install
cd public/
php -S localhost:8000
```
